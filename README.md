This project’s purpose is to develop a single-player Retail Simulator game that entertains users during their free
time while enhancing their resource management and strategic planning abilities. The game simulates the daily
challenges of running a retail store, focusing on key aspects such as inventory management, customer
satisfaction, and financial stability. The user will be able to purchase items, confirm purchases, add stock to the
store, remove stock from the store, and view the store’s sales. They should expect a substantial amount of
planning to manage the store’s stock, budget and reputation, which ultimately impacts their profitability and ability
to pay rent.

The project’s goal is to help kids and teenagers, the target audience, learn how to manage resources, handle
business operations, and understand the relationship between customer satisfaction and financial success
through hands-on experience in a risk-free, entertaining environment. The game is designed to make learning
about retail operations engaging, with quick and easy-to-understand gameplay.
